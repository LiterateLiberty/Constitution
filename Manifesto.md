# Manifesto of the Book Club


## Intent & Purpose

While many profess to be libertarian, or libertarian adjacent in their politics, far fewer can honestly claim that they have read much or any libertarian theory or that they understand the core aspects of its theory. Our aim is to address this woeful inadequacy by maintaining a forum for sharing of knowledge and mutual enrichment.

## Who we are

This book club emerged in YouTuber Mentiswave's Discord server as a way for libertarian and libertarian-curious members of the server to further explore libertarian ideas and theory and has undergone several iterations since then. 

## Who we are **NOT**

While closely tied to Mentiswave and his community this book club is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Mentiswave himself, it is a wholly independent group. Views and ideas expressed by its members and administrators is are entirely their own and should not be attributed to Mentis.

## Book Selection Process & Criteria

The book club's subject of interest is libertarianism and topics which would be of interest to libertarians. These include, but are not necessarily limited to:

* Economics and critique of contrarian economic theories
* Philosophy and ethics
* History, particularly pertaining to that of economic thought, socialism, and liberalism

A suitable book will be selected sometime in the final two weeks before the current book is finished. Members are free to suggest which books and subjects they prefer, but ultimately bookclub admins will have a final say in which book is chosen, whether it's by poll or fiat.

If there is a break or a delay in the presentation of the subject matter a watch party or an essay of a suitable subject matter may be chosen instead.

## Rules

1. **"Don't be a dickhead"**: Pretty simple. Remain civil towards other members and do not shit up the conversation with meaningless nonsense. You will get a warning, but once warned it will be up to the admin's full discretion to remove you.
2. **Follow Discord's TOS**: We do not like them any more than you do. Deal with it.
3. **Follow the host server's rules**: It is the least you can do.
